# Blind-Spot
A Raspberry Pi-based System for Monitoring Objects and Motion for Blind People Walking Stick.

# In this innovative and Incentive project, we use the capabilities of Edge AI, By deploying motion and object detection models directly on Raspberry Pi devices. This not only makes it easier to monitor the daily activities of blind people in real time but also increases their safety by detecting obstacles and classifying scenes. By processing data locally on the periphery, the system provides quick notification of family members about the user's location in real-time and potential dangers, noting significant progress in technology to help the visually impaired.![image](https://github.com/SuneraUdana/Blind-Spot/assets/120769726/79cc137c-4c8f-4d96-a78a-511ef9eb055c)
