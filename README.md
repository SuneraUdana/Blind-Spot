# TensorFlow Lite Python object detection example with Raspberry Pi

This example uses [TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite) with Python on
a Raspberry Pi to perform real-time object detection using images streamed from
the Pi Camera. It draws a bounding box around each detected object in the camera
preview (when the object score is above a given threshold).

At the end of this page, there are extra steps to accelerate the example using
the Coral USB Accelerator to increase inference speed.

## Set up your hardware

Before you begin, you need to
[set up your Raspberry Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up)
with Raspberry Pi OS (preferably updated to Buster).

You also need to
[connect and configure the Pi Camera/web caemra](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.md)
This code also works with a USB/web camera connected to the
Raspberry Pi.

To see the results from the camera, you need a monitor connected to the
Raspberry Pi. It's okay if you're using SSH to access the Pi shell (you don't
need to use a keyboard connected to the Pi)—you only need a monitor attached to
the Pi to see the camera stream.

##First, clone this Git repo onto your Raspberry Pi like this:

Then use our script to install a couple of Python packages, and download the
EfficientDet-Lite model:

In this project, all you need from the TensorFlow Lite API is the `Interpreter`
class. So instead of installing the large `tensorflow` package, we're using the
much smaller `tflite_runtime` package. The setup scripts automatically install
the TensorFlow Lite runtime.

## Run detect.py

```
python3 detect.py \
  --model efficientdet_lite0.tflite
```

You should see the camera feed appear on the monitor attached to your Raspberry
Pi. Put some objects in front of the camera, like a coffee mug or keyboard, and
you'll see boxes drawn around those the model recognizes, including the
label and score for each. It also prints the number of frames per second (FPS)
at the top-left corner of the screen. As the pipeline contains some processes
other than model inference, including visualizing the detection results, you can
expect a higher FPS if your inference pipeline runs in headless mode without
visualization.

For more information about executing inferences with TensorFlow Lite, read
[TensorFlow Lite inference](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference).

  Run the object detection script using the EdgeTPU TFLite model and enable
    the EdgeTPU option. Be noticed that the EdgeTPU requires a specific TFLite
    model which is different from the one used above.
